# WinemakersDB

This is not meant to be a real DB but just a mock up for a next generation (and implementation) of this project, it could created with a normal database hosted in an IPFS.

Inside this folder there should be a file called WinemakersDB.json with an internal structure like this:

[
    {
        "id": "{uuid}",
        "name": "Marchesi Antinori",
        "etherId": "{ganacheAddress}"
    }
]

id is a uuid like this 732bc89f-983e-4ec5-adba-a69197ebd048
name is a random string
ehterId is a ganacheAddress not used as default_user
