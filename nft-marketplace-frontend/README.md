# NFT-Marketplace

## Description
This is a simple university project to show the potentiality of Web3.
I do not own any registered brand name which I'll use on this project, this is not a commercial project, it's just a business idea made by myself. If your brand is on this project and you want it to be removed please contact me on GitHub and I'll do it. 

## Commercial side

This is an app where the users can buy and sell bottles of wine.
The user can link their personal wallet to the platform using the site, this will let the users use their crypto wallet.
The bottle of wine are represented by a NFT which will identify one single bottle.
Buying a NFT from the producer means having a preorder of an "old" wine, while the consumer has the certainty of having a bottle as soon the wine will be available, the producer will receive money to invest on his work.

There are two kind of users:
- The consumer is the user who buy bottles from others users and from the producers, this cannot create new NFTs, but can sell one NFT if he does not want the bottle anymore or if he see that a particular wine is incrementing its market value.
- The producer is the user that produce the wine, he can create new NFT based on the real production of wine. He cannot buy others bottles, neither buying back his own to increment value.
Producers maybe have to be certified when entering the platform (just to be sure he is who he claim to be, this remove frauds, when autheticated he will be "anonymous" like others users).

## Technical side

The project is based on the use of Next.js for the frontend part.
- To launch the project clone the repo.
- Navigate inside the repo where the package.json is.
- Install all the dependencies using ```npm install```.
- Build the project using ```npm run build```.
- Launch the project using ```npm start```.

For the smart contracts I'll use Solidity and an Ethereum testnet.

Soon I'll write the part regarding the smart contracts and Ethereum blockchain.
